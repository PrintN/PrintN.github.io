### What is Google
We enjoy their free services like Google search, Youtube, maps and the list goes on, but we often forget that nothing truly comes for free. Google collects our data with every search and click, building detailed profiles of us along the way. While we think we're just using helpful apps, we're actually giving away our privacy. As we rely more on Google, we have to wonder: what are we giving up in exchange for convenience?


### Why should you care about your privacy?
You've might think “I have nothing to hide, why should I take care of my privacy.” But is that an valid argument? The short answer is NO, there's is plenty of reasons to start taking more care of your privacy:


**Privacy is a Human Right**

Privacy is as fundamental as rights to equality, justice, and freedom.


**"I have nothing to hide"**

Privacy is not secrecy. Just as you close the bathroom door for privacy, you secure your phone and emails—not because you have something to hide, but because privacy is essential to being human.


**Data Breaches**

Would you be comfortable if your private information fell into the hands of someone who could blackmail you or used to commit crimes against you?


**Unpredictability of the Future**

Today’s risks may seem minimal, but future circumstances could change dramatically. Protecting your privacy today is crucial to protecting yourself from potential misuse of your private information in the future.


**Your Information Has Value**

Google may offer free services but profit by selling your data to advertisers without your explicit consent. If asked directly, most individuals would hesitate to sell their personal information, yet it happens every time they use these services.

### DeGoogling your life
Here is a list of alternatives to Google products.
#### 1. Chrome Browser
Don't fall into the trap of switching to a chromium based browser like Brave, Opera and Edge.
- **[LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/)**: An open source custom version of Firefox, focused on privacy, security and freedom.
- **[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)**: While it provides robust protection against tracking and surveillance, be prepared for a slower browsing experience, as your data is routed through a complex onion network to maintain your anonymity.


#### 2. Google Maps
- **[OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)**: Open source mapping project operates on generous data donations. You can only access it via a browser.
- **[OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/)**: Open source map and navigation tool enables you to travel while being offline.


#### 3. Youtube
- **[Odysee](https://odysee.com/)**: One of the most popular Youtube alternatives.


#### 4. Google Authenticator
- **[Aegis Authenticator](https://getaegis.app/)**: An open source app for Android that enables you to secure your accounts with ease while keeping your data private.


#### 5. Gmail
- **[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)**: An open source privacy-focused email service offering end-to-end encryption.
- **Self-Hosted**: This gives you full control over your email privacy and data, but a lot of things could also go wrong if done incorrectly.


#### 6. Google Docs / Sheets / Slides
- **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)**: A powerful open-source suite for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations.


#### 7. Google Play Store
- **[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)**: An open source app store for Android that focuses on user privacy and freedom.


#### 8. Android OS
- **Root your device**: If you want to dive in, you can root your old Android phone and install an open-source OS. Just be careful—it can make your phone less secure and might even make it completely useless it if you're not careful. Not all phones can be rooted, either.
