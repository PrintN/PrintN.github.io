Have you ever seen those ads promising that using a VPN will keep you safe from hackers and government surveillance? It’s easy to get caught up in the hype, but how much of it is actually true?

## What Is A VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that routes your internet traffic through a remote server, masking your IP address and hiding your online activity from your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

## Are VPNs Actually Useful?
You've probably heard that VPNs can help you bypass regional restrictions on streaming services like Netflix. However, the reality is that most VPNs struggle to achieve this. Streaming platforms have become very good at detecting and blocking VPN IP addresses.

So, if VPNs aren’t reliable for accessing region-locked content, what are they good for?

While VPN providers often emphasize their ability to encrypt your traffic, it’s worth noting that encryption is already standard on websites using HTTPS. What VPNs is good at is hiding your real IP address, adding a layer of anonymity to your online activities.

## Can I trust a VPN host over my ISP?
Internet Service Providers (ISP) are notorious for logging your internet activity, which is why many people turn to VPNs for more privacy. But can you really trust a VPN with your data? Some claim to have a "zero-log" policy, but that’s not always guaranteed.

The truth is, VPN trustworthiness varies. A good VPN won’t ask for personal information like your email or phone number and will accept anonymous payments, such as Monero. It’s crucial to remember that governments can legally force VPN companies to hand over data, but if the VPN hasn’t collected any personal information from you, there’s nothing to give.

## How Do I Find A Good VPN?
A good VPN respects your privacy and doesn’t ask for personal information like your email or phone number. One of the best options is [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/){:target="_blank"}, which allows anonymous payments with Monero (XMR) and requires no sign-up details. 

Another solid choice is [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/){:target="_blank"}, known for its strong privacy policies.

## Should I Make My Own VPN?
By creating your own VPN, you eliminate the need to trust a VPN provider, ensuring that you have full control over your data and how it’s handled.

There are two main options for setting up your own VPN:
### Option 1: Cloud-Based VPN
You can host your VPN on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), but you’ll need to trust that VPS provider. For a guide, check out Mental Outlaw’s video.

### Option 2: Dedicated Home Server
This option involves setting up a dedicated computer in a secure location that you can connect to. It's definitely more secure, but it's also way more complicated.
