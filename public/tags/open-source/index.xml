      <description>Definition of Privacy The terms privacy, security, and anonymity are often confused and used interchangeably, yet they each serve distinct purposes in the digital world:
Privacy: The ability to control what information you share and with whom, ensuring that your personal data and activities remain within your chosen boundaries. Security: The protection of your information and digital assets against potential threats or harm, such as hacking or unauthorized access. Anonymity: The ability to act online without revealing your identity, allowing you to engage in activities without being personally identified.</description>
