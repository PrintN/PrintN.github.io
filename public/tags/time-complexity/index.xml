      <description>Introduction to Time Complexity Time complexity measures how the time to complete an algorithm grows with the size of its input. Understanding time complexity is crucial for optimizing performance in software development.
Time Complexity vs. Space Complexity Time Complexity: Focuses on how long an algorithm takes to run. Space Complexity: Relates to how much memory an algorithm uses. Both are essential for efficient software design, as improving one may impact the other.</description>
