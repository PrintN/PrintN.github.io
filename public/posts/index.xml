      <description>What is Google We enjoy their free services like Google search, Youtube, maps and the list goes on, but we often forget that nothing truly comes for free. Google collects our data with every search and click, building detailed profiles of us along the way. While we think we&amp;rsquo;re just using helpful apps, we&amp;rsquo;re actually giving away our privacy. As we rely more on Google, we have to wonder: what are we giving up in exchange for convenience?</description>

      <description>Hello ðŸ‘‹ Today we are going to reverse engineer &amp;ldquo;good_boy&amp;rdquo; by fdisotto. NOTE: Please try to solve this challenge by yourself first before looking at the solution. If you have tried your best and can&amp;rsquo;t solve it then please don&amp;rsquo;t just take the answer and leave immediately because that is not how you learn reverse engineering.
Prerequisites: Ghidra good_boy executable (unzip with password &amp;ldquo;crackmes.one&amp;rdquo;) What does it do? So the program is very simple it just asks us to provide a password when running it and if we give the false password it calls us a bad boy.</description>
