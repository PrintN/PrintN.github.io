      <description>Hello ðŸ‘‹ Today we are going to reverse engineer &amp;ldquo;easy_reverse&amp;rdquo; from cbm-hackers. NOTE: Please try to solve this challenge by yourself first before looking at the solution. If you have tried your best and can&amp;rsquo;t solve it then please don&amp;rsquo;t just take the answer and leave immediately because that is not how you learn reverse engineering.
Prerequisites: Ghidra easy_reverse executable (unzip with password &amp;ldquo;crackmes.one&amp;rdquo;) What does it do? So the program is very simple it just asks us to provide a password when running it.</description>

Prerequisites: Ghidra good_boy executable (unzip with password &amp;ldquo;crackmes.one&amp;rdquo;) What does it do? So the program is very simple it just asks us to provide a password when running it and if we give the false password it calls us a bad boy.</description>
