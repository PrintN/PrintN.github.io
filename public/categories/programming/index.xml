      <description>Introduction to Time Complexity Time complexity measures how the time to complete an algorithm grows with the size of its input. Understanding time complexity is crucial for optimizing performance in software development.
Time Complexity vs. Space Complexity Time Complexity: Focuses on how long an algorithm takes to run. Space Complexity: Relates to how much memory an algorithm uses. Both are essential for efficient software design, as improving one may impact the other.</description>

      <description>Introduction F-Droid is an open source app repository that provides a wide range of free and open source applications for Android devices. It offers a user-friendly alternative to Google Play, focusing on privacy and transparency. I just recently published my app to F-Droid, you can check it out here ðŸ‘‰ Human Benchmark {:target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;}.
Prerequisites A Linux environment (use a virtual machine if you&amp;rsquo;re on Windows). The app&amp;rsquo;s source code must be publicly accessible on a version control system like GitHub.</description>
