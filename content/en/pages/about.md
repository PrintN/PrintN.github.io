Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm PrintN. I like to build software, I also like playing CTFs. I'm currently learning reverse engineering. I have been doing cybersecurity and programming for about 2 years now as a hobby.

#### Projects

    I built this YouTube automation bot as a fun side project using Python and GitHub Actions to run daily. I wanted to learn more about video creation with Python and was inspired by the many automated channels on YouTube.

    <summary style="font-weight:bold">KnowYourTool</summary>
    KnowYourTool was my first major projectâ€”a free online platform designed to be a comprehensive library of useful web tools. I started by creating a Flask website hosted on Google Cloud, where I built my own tools from scratch. As I explored the landscape, I noticed many similar sites already existed, so I decided to take a different approach and innovate. Inspired by ProductHunt, I transformed KnowYourTool into a well-organized directory where users could search for tools like 'Video Downloader' and discover the best options available, complete with descriptions, user comments, and ratings.

Developing this project taught me a lot, from web hosting and WordPress to APIs, community building, and managing databases. Although I eventually stepped away due to the project's initial lack of planning, Iâ€™m proud of what I built and grateful for the valuable lessons it taught me.

#### Contributions

    <summary style="font-weight:bold">AimStar</summary>
    AimStar is an open-source external cheat for Counter-Strike 2. This was my first contribution to another open-source project. I added a hotkey for the ESP feature, which was simple to implement but very useful, as it allows players to play more naturally.
